# Qt 5 - Topaz Thirty-One #

----------

This implementation of the card game [Thirty-One](http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/thirty-one/ "http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/thirty-one/") was written in C++ utilizing the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/ "https://www.qt.io/") framework.

In this version of Thirty-One, you play against three computer based opponents. The game is fast-paced and your opponents are aggressive in their play.  This is a fun game to play, whether computer based or with actual cards and friends.  I hope you enjoy it!  

**Warning:** The stakes are quite high in this game with valuable gems and gold coins as tokens.  

The programs original purpose was as a demonstration program for a CS3350 Event-Driven Programming class at Bemidji State University. Qt proved to be a solid choice for demonstrating event-driven programming.

The current version utilizes Qt 5.7.1 and C++ from Visual Studio 2015. The code has changed little since it was created with Qt 4 in 2009.
